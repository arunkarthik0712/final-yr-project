Abstract:

My project, entitled “Staff Management System,” was designed to assist the staff of my BCA department in enhancing their profiles and tracking their updated work. The project consists of two categories: staff login, which redirects to another page where staff members can update their details, and user view, where students and staff can see details of staff’s recent research papers, educational qualifications, and achievements. Additionally, this project has a cron mail system to remind staffs to update their profiles.
